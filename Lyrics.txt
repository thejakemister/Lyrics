    The Best of Both Worlds
    Hannah Montana
    
    Oh, yeah
    C'mon on!

    You get the limo out front (oh-woah)
    Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
    Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
    It's really you, but no one ever discovers
    In some ways, you're just like all your friends
    But on stage, you're a star

    You get the best of both worlds
    Chill it out, take it slow
    Then you rock out the show
    You get the best of both worlds
    Mix it all together, and you know that it's the best of both worlds
    The best of both worlds, yeah

    You go to movie premiers (Is that Orlando Bloom?)
    Hear your songs on the radio
    Living two lives is a little weird, yeah
    But school's cool, 'cause nobody knows
    Yeah, you get to be a small town girl
    But big time when you play your guitar

    You get the best of both worlds
    Chill it out, take it slow
    Then you rock out the show
    You get the best of both worlds
    Mix it all together, and you know that it's the best of both
    You know the best of both worlds

    Pictures and autographs
    You get your face in all the magazines
    The best part is that you get to be whoever you wanna be
    (Best! Best!) Yeah, the best of both!
    (Best! Best!) You got the best of both!
    (Best! Best!) C'mon, best of both!
    Who would've thought that a girl like me would double as a superstar?

    You get the best of both worlds
    Chill it out, take it slow
    Then you rock out the show
    You get the best of both worlds
    Mix it all together, and you know that it's the best
    You get the best of both worlds
    Without the shades and the hair you can go anywhere
    You get the best of both girls
    Mix it all together, oh yeah
    It's so much better, 'cause you know you got the best of both worlds
